## Reporting Security Issues

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, we encourage you to report it responsibly.

**How to report:**

Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting:
1. Navigate to the Security tab of the repository
2. Click "Report a vulnerability"
3. Provide details about the issue

**Please do not:**
- Open public issues for security vulnerabilities
- Disclose vulnerabilities publicly before they are addressed

We will investigate all legitimate reports and work to address confirmed issues quickly.

## Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the latest stable release.

Thank you for helping keep Celeste secure.
